        Hello! I'm a passionate developer who has just started school as a
        front-end developer. My training includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        various front-end frameworks.. <br />

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
          I began learning HTML about a year ago, dedicating 100 to 160 hours to
          mastering it outside of my formal education, which started in 2024. My
          skills have been developed through a combination of Udemy courses and
          self-directed learning.

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
          I started learning CSS about a year ago, investing 40 to 100 hours in
          honing my skills independently before beginning my formal education in
          2024. I've gained my expertise through a mix of Udemy courses and
          self-guided practice.

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          About a year ago, I embarked on learning JavaScript, spending 20 to 40
          hours refining my abilities on my own, prior to starting my formal
          education in 2024. I've built my knowledge through a blend of Udemy
          courses and self-driven learning.
